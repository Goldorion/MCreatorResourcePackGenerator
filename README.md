# MCreatorResourcePackGenerator
**Features:**
* Create block and item textures directly into MCreator
* Change Minecraft item names
* Create armor textures with MCreator

**Importants:**
* For the armour, you will have to rename the head and body items for helmet and chestplate. (For example, diamond_head -> diamond_helmet and diamond_body -> diamond_chestplate)
* All workspace settings are uselless.
* To put your own logo, take your picture and name it "pack.png". After, take it and put inside the .zip file (Not into the assets folder.)
* Custom sounds work, but only if you put them directly in this folder (MCreatorWorkspace/yourWorkspace/src/main/assets/minecraft/sounds After create the well sub folder(s))
* To add other texture files (entity, GUI, ect.), put them in this global folder MCreatorWorkspace/yourWorkspace/src/main/assets/minecraft/textures After, create the folder you need (entity, gui, etc.)
* Textures are marked as not supported (in red), but it's caused by the "Others" section (I don't support it).
